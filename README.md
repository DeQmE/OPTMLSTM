# Optimum Output LSTM Cell

The code provided in this repository is based on the paper 'Optimum Output Long Short-Term Memory Cell for High-Frequency Trading Forecasting.'
The reader can find the implementation of the OPTM-LSTM cell based on a randomly generated dataset that is for illustration purposes only.
The paper utilizes high-frequency limit order book datasets as input information to the OPTM-LSTM.
